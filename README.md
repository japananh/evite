# Evite - App Invitation Service

## Requirements

- [x] The App Admin generates an invitation token (6 - 12 digit alphanumberic string)
- [x] The invitation token is then used to log in
- [x] The APIs should be REST-ful
- [x] The admin endpoints should be authenticated with JWT
- [x] Invite tokens to expire after 7 days
- [x] Invite tokens can be recalled (disabled)
- [x] A public endpoint for validating the invite token
- [x] Develop the API in Golang
- [x] Frameworks/Libraries: Gin, Gorm,
- [x] Use in-memory storage for the tokens (Redis)
- [x] Use an actual DB
- [x] Deployment instructions are written in `README.md` 
- [x] Write tests (unit tests and integration tests)
- [x] An admin can get an overview of active and inactive tokens
- [ ] Document the APIs in Swagger
- [ ] The invite token validation logic needs to be throttled (limit the requests coming from a
  specific client)

## How to run this project

You need to install Go version >= 1.18 and an IDE/editor such as Goland or VSCode to run the project.
All scripts can be found at ```Makefile```.

```bash
# create `.env` file
cp .env.template .env
# run docker-compose to create MySQL database and Go server
make start
# down all services
make stop
# run unit test locally
make test
```

## CI/CD

The server uses [pre-commit hook](https://github.com/dnephin/pre-commit-golang). Run these scripts below before creating a commit.

Install requires libraries:
- pre-commit: https://pre-commit.com/#installation
- golangci-lint: https://golangci-lint.run/usage/install/#local-installation

```bash
# Run pre-commit install to install pre-commit into your git hooks. pre-commit will now run on every commit.
pre-commit install
```
